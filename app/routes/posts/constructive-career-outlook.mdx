# Constructive Career Outlook

Twelve years ago, I joined my current company as a part-timer when I was a student in college. If the hiring criteria, which are in place now, were there back then, I believe that they wouldn’t have hired me. I was just passionate about programming, and everyday implementing small programs. I was enjoying the fun part of I.T., so I was never considering my career. Current hiring criteria emphasizes the correlation between a person’s career outlook and the work he or she will do at our company. People who don’t have a constructive career outlook are not valued.
